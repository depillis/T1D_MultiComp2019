To run: 
Type ParamSensitivityNodAndBalbC at Matlab prompt.
In that file, set NOD=1 to run NOD mouse case, and NOD = 0 for BalbC case.

Updating the "Swedish Flag" plot with the new "eta_vary" (eta_e) version of
the ODE system.

NOD mouse case again
5% parameter change
Only 4 clearance rate parameters - f1n (fM_n - NOD-basal phagocytosis for Macrophage), f2n (fMa_n - NOD-activated phagocytorsis for Macrophage), fD_n, ftD_n.
Days 5, 10, 15 (apoptotic wave), 150, 300

Trying different time points for the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.
From Marissa's codes, the fig_5 codes are the sensitivity analyses for the NOD mice.

Look at parameter sensitivity results at three time points. 
Look at separate time point plots
Look at days 37, 45, 60, steady state (or see if Blerta finds some later on time points that are interesting.)

NOD mouse case
No treatment
5% parameter change (but think about playing with this).
Decide after what subset of parameters we want to look at.
Send preliminary results to Blerta.
