## Filesystem:
Each folder has its own README - this README is just to provide an overview of the entire repository.

* **Results**: This folder contains all figures and deliverables. It currently contains:
  * Comparison figures: comparing multi- and single compartmental models
  * Local sensitivity figures: Sorted results of local parameter sensitivity on Balb/C and NOD on a timescale of 10 and 40 weeks, with a change of 5 percent
  * Global to local sensitivity figures: Sorted results of the average change in glucose
  * Swedish flag plots of fM and fMa
  * fM/fMa heatmaps
  * alpha eta/beta etas heatmaps
  

* **multicompartment-eta-function**: contains for the multicompartmental model with an eta function. This is the final version of the model from the 2019 REU.

* **single-compartmental**: contains all files pertaining to the single compartmental model.

* **fM-fMa-swedish-flag-plots**: contains the figures and code used to make the swedish flag plots analyzing the sensitivity of the clearance rates in the multicompartmental model

* **global-to-local-param-sensitivity**: contains the code and figures used to do global to local sensitivity for the finalized multicompartmental model

* **heatmaps-alpha-beta**: contains code and figures for heatmaps with varying eta_alpha and eta_beta

* **heatmaps-fM-fMa**: contains code and figures for heatmaps with varying fM and fMa

* **simple-local-sensitivity**: contains code and figures for local parameter sensitivity
